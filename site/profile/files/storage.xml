<!-- storage.xml for T2_UK_SGrid_Bristol

    Storage element:  lcgse01.phy.bris.ac.uk
    Storage software: DMlite 0.7.3
    Phedex host:      heplnv144.pp.rl.ac.uk

    All CMS data are stored using the /store convention
    Therefore we only need to map:
           /+store/(.*)
    
    Special case: LoadTest. Needs to come first for every type of mapping.
